# GhostBusters in Asturias

## Project Description

Something strange is happening in Asturias!

Residents of various areas have started noticing paranormal phenomena: feudal ghosts, invisible sailors, levitating nuns, and terrifying shadows. As part of the new **GhostBusters** team, your mission is to investigate these phenomena, capture ghosts, and maintain peace in the region.

The operations base is located in an old industrial warehouse in AvilÃ©s, equipped with ectoplasmic storage traps and advanced paranormal detection equipment. Every corner of Asturias may hold unsolved mysteries. Can you keep the region safe and face the most dangerous specters?

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

This project follows the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology, ensuring code quality and reliability. Each feature is implemented through these steps:
1. Write a unit test in **JUnit** based on acceptance criteria.
2. Run the test and ensure it fails.
3. Implement the functionality until the test passes.
4. Refactor the code while keeping the test green.
